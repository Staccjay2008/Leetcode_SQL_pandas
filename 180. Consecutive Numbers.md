```180. Consecutive Numbers

Table: Logs

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
In SQL, id is the primary key for this table.
id is an autoincrement column starting from 1.
 

Find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.
```
```Python
import pandas as pd

# Sample data in a pandas DataFrame
data = {'id': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
        'num': ['1', '1', '1', '2', '1', '2', '2']}

logs = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Ensure the data is sorted by 'id' (although it's already sorted in this case)
logs = logs.sort_values(by='id')

# Check for consecutive numbers
logs['prev_num'] = logs['num'].shift(1)
logs['next_num'] = logs['num'].shift(-1)

# Find the numbers that appear at least 3 times consecutively
consecutive_nums = logs[(logs['num'] == logs['prev_num']) & (logs['num'] == logs['next_num'])]

# Extract the unique numbers that appear consecutively at least 3 times
result = consecutive_nums['num'].unique()

# Create the final result DataFrame
result_df = pd.DataFrame(result, columns=['ConsecutiveNums'])

# Show the result
print(result_df)
```
