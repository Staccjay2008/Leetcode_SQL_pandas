#### 183. Customers Who Never Order
```
Table: Customers

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID and name of a customer.
 

Table: Orders

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| customerId  | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
customerId is a foreign key (reference columns) of the ID from the Customers table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of an order and the ID of the customer who ordered it.
 

Write a solution to find all customers who never order anything.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Customers table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
Orders table:
+----+------------+
| id | customerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
Output: 
+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+
```
```python
import pandas as pd

def find_customers(customers: pd.DataFrame, orders: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
        # Select the rows which `id` is not present in orders['customerId'].
    df = customers[~customers['id'].isin(orders['customerId'])]

    # Build a dataframe that only contains the column `name` 
    # and rename the column `name` as `Customers`.
    df = df[['name']].rename(columns={'name': 'Customers'})
    return df
```

The provided function `find_customers` is designed to find customers from the `customers` DataFrame whose `id` is not present in the `orders` DataFrame's `customerId` column. Then, it renames the `name` column to `Customers` and returns the resulting DataFrame.

Let’s break down the function step by step:

### Code Explanation:

```python
import pandas as pd

def find_customers(customers: pd.DataFrame, orders: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Step 1: Select rows where `id` from `customers` is not in `orders['customerId']`
    df = customers[~customers['id'].isin(orders['customerId'])]

    # Step 2: Keep only the 'name' column and rename it as 'Customers'
    df = df[['name']].rename(columns={'name': 'Customers'})

    # Step 3: Return the modified DataFrame
    return df
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **`~customers['id'].isin(orders['customerId'])`**:
   - The `isin()` method checks if each value in `customers['id']` exists in `orders['customerId']`.
   - The tilde `~` operator negates the result, so it selects rows where the `id` from `customers` is **not** in the `customerId` from `orders`.
   - This effectively gives us a DataFrame of customers who have not placed any orders.

2. **`df[['name']]`**:
   - This filters the DataFrame `df` to only include the `name` column, keeping only the relevant information for customers.

3. **`rename(columns={'name': 'Customers'})`**:
   - The `rename()` method renames the `name` column to `Customers` for clarity in the result.

4. **`return df`**:
   - Finally, the modified DataFrame `df` is returned, which contains the names of customers who haven't placed an order.

### Example Usage:

Here’s how the function would work with an example:

```python
# Sample customers DataFrame
customers_data = {
    'id': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Eve']
}
customers = pd.DataFrame(customers_data)

# Sample orders DataFrame
orders_data = {
    'orderId': [101, 102, 103],
    'customerId': [1, 3, 4]
}
orders = pd.DataFrame(orders_data)

# Call the function
result = find_customers(customers, orders)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

### Output:

```
  Customers
1       Bob
5       Eve
```

### Explanation:
- **`customers`** has 5 customers, with `id` values 1 through 5.
- **`orders`** has 3 orders, with `customerId` values 1, 3, and 4.
- The function identifies customers whose `id` is not present in `orders['customerId']`, which are `Bob` (id 2) and `Eve` (id 5).
- The function returns a DataFrame containing the `Customers` column with these names.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly identifies customers who have not made any orders and returns their names in a DataFrame with a renamed column. This solution is efficient and easy to understand.
