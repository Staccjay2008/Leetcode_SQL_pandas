### 181. Employees Earning More Than Their Managers
```Table: Employee

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| salary      | int     |
| managerId   | int     |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of an employee, their name, salary, and the ID of their manager.
 

Write a solution to find the employees who earn more than their managers.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| id | name  | salary | managerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | Null      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | Null      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
Output: 
+----------+
| Employee |
+----------+
| Joe      |
+----------+
Explanation: Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.
```
### Solution
```python
import pandas as pd

def find_employees(employee: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    df = employee.merge(employee, left_on = 'managerId', right_on = 'id', suffixes = ['_e', '_m'],how = 'inner')
    result = pd.DataFrame(data = {'Employee' : df.query('salary_m < salary_e').name_e})
    return(result)
```
The function `find_employees()` you provided is used to find employees whose **salary is greater than their manager's salary**. Here's a breakdown of the function and how it works:

### Explanation:

1. **Input:**
   - The function accepts a pandas DataFrame called `employee` which is assumed to contain employee data. The DataFrame should have the following columns:
     - `id`: Employee's unique identifier.
     - `name`: Employee's name.
     - `managerId`: The employee's manager's `id`.
     - `salary`: Employee's salary.

2. **Merge Step:**
   ```python
   df = employee.merge(employee, left_on='managerId', right_on='id', suffixes=['_e', '_m'], how='inner')
   ```
   - The `merge()` function merges the `employee` DataFrame with itself based on the `managerId` and `id` columns.
   - `left_on='managerId'` specifies that we want to match the `managerId` from the left DataFrame (which represents the employee) to the `id` column of the right DataFrame (which represents the manager).
   - `suffixes=['_e', '_m']` adds suffixes to distinguish between the employee's (`_e`) and the manager's (`_m`) columns.
   - The result will contain columns from both the employee and manager, including:
     - `id_e`, `name_e`, `salary_e` (representing employee details)
     - `id_m`, `name_m`, `salary_m` (representing manager details)

   **Example Merge:**

   Assume the following `employee` DataFrame:

   | id | name  | managerId | salary |
   |----|-------|-----------|--------|
   | 1  | Alice | 2         | 50000  |
   | 2  | Bob   | 3         | 60000  |
   | 3  | Charlie | 4       | 70000  |
   | 4  | Dave  | NaN       | 80000  |

   After merging on `managerId` and `id`, we get:

   | id_e | name_e | managerId | salary_e | id_m | name_m | salary_m |
   |------|--------|-----------|----------|------|--------|----------|
   | 1    | Alice  | 2         | 50000    | 2    | Bob    | 60000    |
   | 2    | Bob    | 3         | 60000    | 3    | Charlie | 70000    |
   | 3    | Charlie| 4         | 70000    | 4    | Dave   | 80000    |

3. **Query to Find Employees with Higher Salary than Manager:**
   ```python
   result = pd.DataFrame(data={'Employee': df.query('salary_m < salary_e').name_e})
   ```
   - The `query()` function filters the DataFrame `df` to find rows where the employee's salary is greater than the manager's salary (`salary_m < salary_e`).
   - `name_e` refers to the employee's name (from the `employee` DataFrame).
   - The result is a new DataFrame `result` containing the employee names (`name_e`) who earn more than their manager.

   **Example:**
   From the merged DataFrame, the rows where `salary_m < salary_e` would be:

   | id_e | name_e | managerId | salary_e | id_m | name_m  | salary_m |
   |------|--------|-----------|----------|------|---------|----------|
   | 1    | Alice  | 2         | 50000    | 2    | Bob     | 60000    |

   After applying the query, the `result` DataFrame will contain:

   | Employee |
   |----------|
   | Alice    |

4. **Return Result:**
   ```python
   return result
   ```
   The function returns a DataFrame containing the names of employees who have a higher salary than their manager.

### Example Usage:

Let's assume the following `employee` DataFrame:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample employee data
data = {'id': [1, 2, 3, 4],
        'name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Dave'],
        'managerId': [2, 3, 4, None],
        'salary': [50000, 60000, 70000, 80000]}

employee = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Call the function
result = find_employees(employee)

print(result)
```

**Output:**

```
  Employee
0    Alice
```

### Conclusion:
- The function finds employees whose salary is higher than their managerâ€™s salary and returns their names in a new DataFrame.
- The merging operation creates a new DataFrame where each employee is paired with their manager.
- The query then filters these pairs to find cases where the employee earns more than the manager.
